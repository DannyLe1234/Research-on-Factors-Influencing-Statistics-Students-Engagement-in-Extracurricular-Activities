# üìä Analyzing Factors Influencing Extracurricular Activity Participation
This is a group based project that I made for the class **STA304: Surveys, Sampling and Observational Data**, this course focus on the designs of surveys, sampling techniques and how to address biasness in observational data emphasizing both sampling inference and the impact of non-sampling errors on survey results. For this project our team conducted a study to investigates which factors are significantly associated with the likelihood of student participation in extracurricular activities.

The objective of this project is to explore and analyze potential determinants of extracurricular activity participation among university students, such as:

- Social support from friends and family


> The study employs the following statistical methods including:

- **Two-sample proportion tests**

- **Chi-square test of independence**

- **Logistic regression analysis**


# üìù Research Questions
- **Do personal preferences influence participation in extracurricular activities?**

- **To what extent do academic/work commitments affect participation?**

- **Does perceived importance of extracurriculars differ between domestic and international students?**

- **Do opinions of family/friends influence a student's participation decision?**
